# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

### Step 1
Upload the a file named inputs.csv to the same directory with the source code files
NB: There is one that is currently in the directory so you can just edit that. If you
chose to test with your own then make sure it is a .csv file
Editing guidelines: It should have two lines: the start city and country should be on the first line,
and the destination city and country on the second line. There should be a comma between
the city name and the country name. For example:

Accra, Ghana
Winnipeg, Canada

### Step 2
The commands I will give below are for running the code using the terminal.

Open the terminal and paste the [link found here](https://github.com/tinotenda-alfaneti/route-search-individual-project.git) 

The navigate to the folder route-search-individual-project using `cd route-search-individual-project`

NB:Make sure you are in the directory where the source code files are.

#### Windows 
(If you are using the g++ compiler)
run `g++ *.cpp -o output`
then execute the code with `.\output.exe`

#### Linux
(If you are using the g++ compiler)
run `g++ *.cpp -o output`
then execute the code with `./output`

#### MacOS

run `gcc *.cpp -o main.out`
then execute with `./main.out`

### STEP 3
Read the outputFile.txt to see the results and safe journey to wherever you want to go.

:warning: NB: Please make sure the version of C++ you are using is version 11+
